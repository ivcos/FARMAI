This website gives farmers visibility as to when the tanks will be full.
Ultrasonic Sensors are installed on tanks to measure the distance from the top of
the tank to the top of the fluid. The difference between the distance measured 
by the ultrasonic sensor and the height of the tank is the height of the material
in the tank. Sesor measurements were collected for the period from the 2023-10-15
and 2023-11-30. These measurements were used as as an input into a Linear Regression
Macheine Learning Model.  This model is then used to predict the height measured by the sensor
and the volume per tank on a daily basis.

In the tankpredictions.html, the user can the see the predicted height measured by the sensor
and the % capacity in the tank.
